# Overview of the Pokemon app

Pokemon web app is a web-app, which consists of features that fetch all the Pokemon characters and also details about them.

## Installation

Use the package manager (npm or yarn) to install packages used in the project.

```bash
npm install
     or
yarn install
```

## TOOLING USED

```python
 - REACT (Next JS): Frontend Javascript Framework
 - Restful API (REST)
 - Chakra UI: CSS Framework for building UI component
 - Redux for state management
 - Fetch for making requests to the server over the browser
 - Lint: Prettier Formatter

```

## Core Element of the Solution

```python
‚úÖ Ability to implement pagination.
‚úÖ Ability to integrate a Pokemon API to fetch characters.
‚úÖ Clean-code and separation of component concerns
‚úÖ Usage of Nextjs for Frontend
‚úÖ Fetch single data per character
‚úÖ Usage of Nextjs for Frontend
‚úÖ Built an intuitive UI with mobile responsiveness in mind
```

## Uncompleted Task

```python
‚ùå unable to do the search implementation of a character
# Reason: couldn't find the API on the documentation for it.
```

## Features to be improved on

```python
   I feel the loading state could be handled a bit better than how I did it
   Testing (unit or e2e) is a vital improvement for the mini pokemon app
```
